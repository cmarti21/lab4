			<p class="item">Electrical engineering is a technical discipline concerned with the study, design and application of equipment, devices and systems which use electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. It emerged as an identified activity in the latter half of the 19th century after commercialization of the electric telegraph, the telephone, and electrical power generation, distribution and use.</p>
			<p class="item">It is now divided into a wide range of fields including, computer engineering, power engineering, telecommunications, radio-frequency engineering, signal processing, instrumentation, and electronics. Many of these disciplines overlap with other engineering branches, spanning a huge number of specializations including <b>hardware engineering, power electronics, electromagnetics and waves, microwave engineering, nanotechnology, electrochemistry, renewable energies, mechatronics, and electrical materials science.</b></p>
			<p class="item">An electrical engineer is someone who designs and develops new electrical systems, solves problems and tests equipment. They study and apply the physics and mathematics of electricity, electromagnetism and electronics to both large and small scale systems to process information and transmit energy. They work with all kinds of electronic devices, from the smallest pocket devices to large supercomputers.</p>
			<p class="item">Electrical engineers work in a very wide range of industries and the skills required are likewise variable. These range from circuit theory to the management skills of a project manager. The tools and equipment that an individual engineer may need are similarly variable, ranging from a simple voltmeter to a top end analyzer to sophisticated design and manufacturing software.</p>
			<p class="item">Some of the most prominent pioneers in electrical engineering include Thomas Edison (electric light bulb), George Westinghouse (alternating current), Nikola Tesla (induction motor), Guglielmo Marconi (radio) and Philo T. Farnsworth (television). These innovators turned ideas and concepts about electricity into practical devices and systems that ushered in the modern age. </p>

			<h3>...Hardware engineering</h3>
			<p>Hardware Engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing and producing computer systems and various physical components related to computer systems. With the advent of technology and advances in R&D, the scope of hardware engineering has been expanded to include hardware devices enabling embedded software engineering in non-computer devices. In embedded systems, hardware engineering comprises of the process of design and development of all electronics related hardware such as sensors, processors and controllers.... <a href="https://www.hcltech.com/technology-qa/what-is-hardware-engineering">Click here to learn more</a></p>

			<h3>...Microwave engineering</h3>
			<p>Microwave engineering pertains to the study and design of microwave circuits, components, and systems. Fundamental principles are applied to analysis, design and measurement techniques in this field. The short wavelengths involved distinguish this discipline from Electronic engineering. This is because there are different interactions with circuits, transmissions and propagation characteristics at microwave frequencies.Some theories and devices that pertain to this field are antennas, radar, transmission lines, space based systems (remote sensing), measurements, microwave radiation hazards and safety measures.... <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_engineering">Click here to learn more</a></p>

			<h3>...Renewable energy engineers</h3>
			<p>Renewable energy engineers are part of the growing sector of green jobs that involve environmentally conscious production. These individuals maximize the energy potential of clean energy sources including wind, solar, geothermal and hydropower. Renewable energy engineers monitor and develop alternative energy outputs. They may pursue different careers paths such as consultants and researchers. Similar to other engineering fields, renewable energy engineers must have an aptitude for math and science. They need to be able to apply these principles.....<a href="https://study.com/articles/Renewable_Energy_Engineer_Job_Information_for_Recent_Graduates_Pursuing_a_Career_in_Renewable_Energy_Engineering.html">Click here to learn more</a></p>
